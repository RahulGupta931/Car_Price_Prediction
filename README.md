## Project Overview
Car price prediction is a crucial task in the automotive industry, benefiting both buyers and sellers. This project focuses on building a regression model to predict car prices based on various features.

## Features
- Predict car prices with high accuracy.
- Preprocess and analyze data to identify key trends.
- Deploy the model using Flask.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **Columns**: name, company,	year,	Price,	kms_driven,	fuel_type

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, pickle
- **Frameworks**: Flask
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

## Modeling
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Scale numerical features.
2. **Model Selection**:
   - Compare algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.).
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics: RÂ² Score.

## Results
- Achieved **90% accuracy** on test data.
- Model shows robust performance for unseen data.

## How to Run
